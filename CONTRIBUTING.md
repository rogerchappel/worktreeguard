## Verification

Every contribution should include verification.

- Documentation: inspect rendered Markdown or review the diff.
- Tests: run the targeted test command.
- Types: run the project typecheck.
- Build: run the smallest build command that covers the change.
- Manual QA: provide exact steps and observed result.

If verification cannot be run, explain why and provide the exact command maintainers should run.

## Maintainer Review

Maintainers may request narrower scope, clearer verification, additional tests, or safer defaults before merging.
