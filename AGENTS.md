# Agent Operating Instructions for worktreeguard

This file defines how AI agents and human maintainers should work in `worktreeguard`.

## Project Context

- Project: `worktreeguard`
- Repository: ``
- Primary maintainer: ``
- Default branch: ``
- Package manager: ``
- Primary verification command: `bash scripts/validate.sh`

## Core Principle

Move quickly, but keep every change reviewable, reversible, verifiable, and safe.

## Branch Policy

- Work on a branch for all repository changes.
- Branch from the latest `` before editing.
- Do not merge without explicit maintainer approval.
- Do not rewrite shared history unless explicitly instructed.

## Atomic Commits

- Use Conventional Commits.
- One commit should represent one reviewable intent.
- Keep unrelated docs, code, tests, generated files, dependency changes, and CI changes in separate commits.
- Hard gate: if a change touches more than 3 files, split it into smaller commits unless it is a scaffold, generated output, lockfile-only dependency update, or clearly mechanical repository-wide rename.
- If a task may touch more than 3 files, write the split plan before editing.

Allowed commit types:

- `feat:`
- `fix:`
- `test:`
- `docs:`
- `refactor:`
- `ci:`
- `chore:`
- `perf:`
- `types:`

## Expected Workflow

Before editing, report:

1. Task objective
2. Expected blast radius
3. Files likely to change
4. Commit plan
5. Verification plan
6. Risk level: low, medium, or high

Then:

1. Create or confirm a branch.
2. Make the smallest coherent change.
3. Review `git status`.
4. Review `git diff`.
5. Stage only files related to the current intent.
6. Run `bash scripts/validate.sh` or a smaller targeted check when appropriate.
7. Commit atomically.
8. Return a review pack.

## Verification

Every task must include verification.

Use the smallest relevant check first:

- targeted unit test
- targeted integration test
- typecheck
- lint
- build
- smoke command
- manual documentation review

If verification cannot be run, say why and provide the exact command a maintainer should run.

## Review Pack

Every completed task must return:

```md
## Review Pack
Repo: worktreeguard
Branch:
PR:
Task:
Status: done / blocked / needs review
Summary:
Commits:
Files changed:
Verification:
Risk level:
Rollback plan:
Human decision needed:
Next recommended task:
```

## PR Body Formatting Gate

When opening or updating a pull request, the PR body must follow `.github/pull_request_template.md` unless the maintainer explicitly asks for a different format.

Do not pass PR bodies or review comments as shell strings containing escaped newlines like `\n`. GitHub will render those literally and the comment is not reviewable.

Use a body file or heredoc instead:

```bash
cat > /tmp/pr-body.md <<'EOF'
## Summary

-

## Verification

- [ ] Tests or checks run:
- [ ] Manual review completed:

## Risk Level

- [ ] Low
- [ ] Medium
- [ ] High

Notes:

## Rollback Plan

-

## Human Decision Needed

- [ ] None
- [ ] Maintainer review
- [ ] Product/design decision
- [ ] Security/privacy review
- [ ] Other:
EOF

gh pr create --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md
```

Before creating or updating a PR, inspect the final rendered source:

```bash
cat /tmp/pr-body.md
```

If the preview contains literal `\n`, missing headings, or does not match the repository template, fix it before posting.

## Safety Rules

Stop and ask before touching:

- authentication or authorization
- security controls
- payments or billing
- production data
- data deletion or destructive commands
- database migrations
- secrets or environment variables
- public API compatibility
- licensing
- telemetry, analytics, or privacy behavior
- production configuration
- major dependency upgrades

Never commit secrets. Never mutate production data unless explicitly instructed.
